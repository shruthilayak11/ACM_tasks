## 1: Automate the vit wifi login +  automate the login procedure itself
## How I managed to do it:
- As soon as I saw the task the forst thing that popped in my mind is the `selenium tool` and as am good at python I created a pyhton script using selenium package with some help from chatgpt.
- then i used batch to automate it at the start up (I have some knowledgeon basic batch scripting)

## How to use this:
- Downlaod the `python` and `batch` file.
- save them in the `shell:script`, which you'll find by running shell:script in `run`
- click on the python file and edit it in any text file and replace the `your_username` and `your_password` with respectibve credentials

 ```@python
# Replace with your own login credentials
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
```
### Remember to enable the automatic connect in wifi ;)
